# Code of Conduct

We want Web2RU to be a welcoming, harassment-free community for everyone.

This project follows the **Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1)**.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and considerate.
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and users.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.
- Personal attacks or trolling.
- Publishing private information (including API keys, tokens, credentials).

## Enforcement

Report unacceptable behavior by contacting the maintainer via GitHub (preferred):
- If you have access to GitHub private contact methods, use them.
- Otherwise, open an issue with minimal details and request a private follow-up channel.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate action.
